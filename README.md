Saying hello to raytracing.

This is a project in my second year of DAE.
Starting a from nothing and implementing all the maths needed to render models onto the screen in any way you want.

This all runs on the cpu so its not that fast eventhough I'm using multithreading.

This projects was meant so I could learn how a raytracer works from the bottom up.
Later I use API's to comnunicate with the GPU: Vulkan, Opengl, etc...
You can also see these projects on my github profile.

What I enjoyed moste about this project is figuring out how to optimize this application.
I was determined to have the fasters spinning bunny of my whole class. :)
I only got to a maximum of 17 FPS or so on cpu rendering on my laptop with 8 cores. (shadows enabled)

Still proud about it till this day.
