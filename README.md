Saying hello to raytracing.

This is a project in my second year of DAE.
Starting a from nothing and implementing all the maths needed to render models onto the screen in any way you want.

This all runs on the cpu so its not that fast eventhough I'm using multithreading.

This projects was meant so I could learn how a raytracer works from the bottom up.
Later I use API's to comnunicate with the GPU: Vulkan, Opengl, etc...
You can also see these projects on my github profile.
